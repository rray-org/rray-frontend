// `state-management.mjs` — `autorun` /
// `autopromise` are thin wrappers around @nx-js/observer-util.
// Three robustness bugs the original implementation missed:
//
//   * autorun: `first = false` ran AFTER `method(first)` so a
//     synchronous throw on the initial run left `first` stuck at
//     `true`; subsequent re-runs (from observables touched BEFORE
//     the throw) replayed the first-run branch.
//   * autorun: `observe(fn)` runs `fn` before returning the
//     reaction handle. If `fn` throws, the handle never reaches
//     the caller — observer-util's connectionStore retains the
//     reaction for any observable touched before the throw,
//     leaking a broken subscription that re-triggers forever.
//   * autopromise: `promise.finally(dispose)` deferred disposal to
//     a microtask. Synchronous mutations between `resolve()` and
//     the microtask re-ran `condition`, with confusing failure
//     modes when condition threw on a later run.
//
// These tests pin the fixed behaviour.
